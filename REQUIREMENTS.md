  **Prompt**: I prefer step-by-step explanations that include functioning code. Explanations should be clear and concise and always reference the idiomatic practices of Elixir.
- **Debugging Preferences**: How do you prefer to approach debugging? Are there specific tools or techniques you find most effective? 
  **Prompt**: I prefer to use the debugger and IDE features.

### 7. Idiomatic Practices
- **Interest in Idiomatic Practices**: Are there specific idiomatic practices or patterns within the technologies being used (Elixir, Phoenix, etc.) that you are particularly interested in learning or adhering to? 
  **Prompt**: The documentation for Elixir and Phoenix are the source of truth.
- **Importance of Adherence**: How important is it for the code to follow these idiomatic practices strictly? 
  **Prompt**: On a scale of 1-10, I would give it an 8. I believe that following the idiomatic practices is important for the code to be readable and maintainable.

### Functional Requirements
- **Key Requirements**: Can you list the key functional requirements that the application must meet? 
  **Prompt**: To show a rover moving on a grid and displaying the history of its movements on the grid that is controlled by the user via buttons.
- **Non-Functional Considerations**: Are there any non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security) that need to be considered? 
  **Prompt**: The application should be performant and efficient.

### 9. Collaboration and Version Control
- **Version Control Management**: How is the project being managed in terms of version control (e.g., Git workflows)? 
  **Prompt**: Git.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Are there any collaboration tools or platforms being used for the project (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)? 
  **Prompt**: GitHub.

### 10. Testing and Deployment

Project Overview and AI Interaction Guidelines
Project Name: Rover Exploration Grid
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to develop an application that visually represents a rover navigating a grid. The rover's movements are controlled by 'left', 'right', and 'forward' buttons, with its path history indicated by arrows that gradually fade in opacity to a minimum threshold.
Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Elixir 1.14.0
Web Framework: Phoenix Framework (~> 1.7.7)
Real-Time Web: Phoenix LiveView (~> 0.19.0)
Styling: TailwindCSS (~> 0.2.0)
Database: PostgreSQL 15.5
Development Environment: The project utilizes the Cursor text editor, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency in the development setup. No specific configurations are required beyond the standard setup for Elixir and Phoenix projects.
Programming Experience: The developer is a beginner in Elixir, with prior experience in JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The focus is on strengthening understanding in software architecture, idiomatic Elixir practices, and debugging techniques.
Code Style and Practices:
Emphasis on readability, modular code, and adherence to the DRY principle without overcomplication.
Preference for smaller functions and clear, concise code that follows idiomatic Elixir practices.
Debugging is approached with the use of IDE features and the Elixir debugger.
Learning and Debugging Preferences:
Learning is best facilitated through step-by-step explanations, practical examples, and clear documentation references.
Debugging preferences include the use of IDE debugging tools and a methodical approach to problem-solving.
Collaboration and Version Control:
The project is managed using Git, with GitHub serving as the collaboration platform.
Testing is conducted through unit and integration tests, with plans to utilize Docker and Fly.io for deployment.
AI Assistant Guidelines:
The AI assistant, named Jarvis, is expected to produce clear, readable, and idiomatic Elixir code.
Jarvis should adhere strictly to the project's requirements, offering thoughtful, nuanced, and accurate programming advice.
The AI should plan solutions in pseudocode before coding, ensuring all code is correct, up-to-date, and fully functional.
Emphasis is placed on code readability over performance, with a requirement for complete implementation without placeholders or incomplete features.
Special Instructions:
Always align with the specified versions of Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, and TailwindCSS.
The AI's responses and code suggestions should be concise, minimizing unnecessary prose.
In cases of uncertainty, Jarvis should express the lack of a definitive answer rather than guessing.
